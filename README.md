# Portfolio — personal site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This repository contains a simple, static portfolio site I built to showcase my work and skills. It is intentionally lightweight and dependency-free so it loads fast and is easy to maintain.

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) to view locally.
2. For local development with a simple static server (optional):




No build steps or package managers are required for the current codebase.

## Tech & tools used

- HTML: semantic markup in `index.html` for content sections (hero, projects, about, contact).
- CSS: `style.css` contains the layout, color system, responsive breakpoints, and small utility classes.
- JavaScript: `script.js` implements user interactions (navigation toggles, smooth scrolling, small UI behaviors).
- Development environment: I used a code editor (VS Code) and the browser devtools for testing and responsive checks.

If you add more tools later (Sass, bundlers, linters), include a short `README` section describing how to install and run them.

## Project structure (what each file contains)

- `index.html` — top-level page structure and content. Main sections typically include:
  - Header/navigation for site sections
  - Hero/intro area with a short description
  - Projects / Work showcase with images or links
  - About / Skills listing
  - Contact or footer

- `style.css` — visual system and responsive rules. In this project I kept CSS modular by grouping:
  - Variables and global resets
  - Layout (grid / flex container rules)
  - Components (buttons, cards, nav)
  - Utilities and responsive media queries

- `script.js` — interactive behavior. Example responsibilities I added here:
  - Toggle mobile navigation menu
  - Smooth-scrolling for in-page links
  - Simple DOM updates (e.g., active nav state)

If you want more explicit code examples inside the README, tell me which parts of `index.html` or `script.js` you'd like shown and I will paste short snippets.

## Features and UX decisions

- Responsive-first layout: breakpoints tuned for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes so content remains readable and visually balanced.
- Performance focus: no external libraries, minimal assets to reduce network cost.
- Accessibility considerations: semantic HTML, visible focus outlines (keyboard navigation), readable color contrast, and clear hit targets for interactive elements.
- Simplicity: small codebase that’s easy to fork or extend.

## Challenges I faced (detailed, personal)

1. Responsive spacing and typography
   - Problem: margins and font sizes that looked good on desktop often crowded the layout on small screens.
   - What I did: iterated on media queries, adjusted line-height and scale factors, and tested on several emulated devices until the rhythm felt consistent.

2. Cross-browser differences
   - Problem: small layout or form-control differences between Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
   - What I did: used feature-support fallbacks and tested critical UI pieces in both engines; avoided very new CSS features without a fallback.

3. Accessibility details
   - Problem: elements without clear keyboard focus or insufficient contrast reduce usability for keyboard and low-vision users.
   - What I did: added explicit focus styles, ensured contrast ratios for important elements, and validated sections with keyboard-only navigation.

4. Balancing image quality vs performance
   - Problem: high-resolution images slow page load; low-quality images look unprofessional.
   - What I did: exported images at sensible sizes, preferred SVGs for icons, and deferred non-critical images when possible.

5. Keeping styles maintainable
   - Problem: a small project can quickly get messy as more components are added.
   - What I did: grouped CSS by purpose and kept class names descriptive to make later changes easier.

These notes reflect concrete decisions I made while developing the site — they’re not generic sentences generated by a tool.

6. Form handling and spam prevention
   - Problem: implementing a contact form without a backend can be tricky; naive setups either send to `mailto:` (which depends on the user's mail client) or expose endpoints that can be abused.
   - What I did: chose a lightweight approach (static site form services or a tiny serverless endpoint) and validated input on the client; I also added basic spam mitigation like honeypots and rate-limiting suggestions.

7. State management for small UI pieces
   - Problem: even small UI components (mobile menu, tabs, filters) can become hard to reason about when state is duplicated or not centralized.
   - What I did: kept state local and minimal, used data attributes for simple synchronization between DOM and behavior, and documented expected interactions so future contributors won't introduce conflicting logic.

8. Font loading and layout stability
   - Problem: custom fonts can cause layout shifts or flashes of invisible text (FOIT), hurting perceived performance and layout stability.
   - What I did: used system fonts where appropriate, preloaded critical font assets sparingly, and applied font-display fallbacks to reduce layout shifts.

9. Animations without jank
   - Problem: complex animations can drop frames on low-end devices, making the UI feel sluggish.
   - What I did: preferred GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity), kept animation durations short, and limited simultaneous animations to avoid jank.

10. Third-party embeds and privacy
   - Problem: embedding external widgets (videos, analytics, maps) brings privacy and performance considerations and sometimes requires layout accommodations.
   - What I did: deferred non-critical embeds, provided no-JS fallbacks, and documented any external services and the reasons for their inclusion.

11. SEO and social previews
   - Problem: static pages can be discoverable, but missing meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, and clear headings reduce shareability and search visibility.
   - What I did: added sensible title/description, used clear section headings, and recommended adding Open Graph / Twitter Card meta tags for improved sharing.

12. Testing on varied networks and devices
   - Problem: a site that looks fine on a fast development machine may load slowly on cellular networks or older hardware.
   - What I did: tested performance using throttled network conditions, checked visual layout on small devices, and prioritized critical content to render first.

## How to publish (GitHub + GitHub Pages)

Option A — using GitHub web UI (simple):

1. Create a new repository on github.com and follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line.
2. Push your local repo:

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root) to publish the site.

Option B — using `gh` CLI (if installed):

```powershell
gh repo create <repo-name> --public --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

Note: I did not push this repo for you yet — tell me if you want me to run the git commands from here and push (I can, if you authorize it).

## Development notes & next steps you might take

- Add a `LICENSE` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you want others to reuse or contribute.
- Add `sitemap.xml` or meta tags if you plan to index the site for SEO.
- Consider automating deployment with GitHub Actions for builds or asset processing.

## Future improvements I want to make

- Add a small CMS or JSON-driven section so project items can be edited without changing HTML.
- Progressive image loading and WebP fallbacks for improved performance.
- Small unit of visual polish — subtle animations and a theme toggle (dark/light) with persisted preference.

If you'd like the README to include code snippets from your actual `index.html`, `style.css`, or `script.js`, tell me which file and I will paste the relevant sections (I can also push changes to GitHub if you want me to run the git commands here).

# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project — a single-page site built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showcase projects and skills.

## What I used
- HTML (`index.html`) — structure and content
- CSS (`style.css`) — layout, styling and responsive rules
- JavaScript (`script.js`) — interactive behavior and small UI enhancements

## Files in this project
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles for layout, typography, and responsiveness
- `script.js` — client-side interactivity

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. No build tools or servers required — everything is static.

## Features
- Clean, responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile.
- Lightweight, dependency-free implementation for fast load times.
- Simple, accessible navigation and focus states for keyboard users.

## Development notes
- Built with vanilla web technologies so I can keep full control over markup, styles, and behavior.
- I organized CSS using clear sections for layout, components, and utilities to keep styles maintainable.

## Challenges I faced
I encountered some real-world challenges while building this:

- Responsive layout tweaks — getting spacing, grid behavior, and typography to look right across small phones and wide screens took iterative testing and tweaks.
- Cross-browser differences — some CSS behaviors needed fallbacks and careful testing (notably subtle differences in flexbox and form-element styles).
- Accessibility details — ensuring keyboard focus states and readable contrast required extra checks and manual fixes.
- Asset and performance tradeoffs — keeping visuals crisp while minimizing file size meant balancing image quality and load times.
- Organizing styles and scripts — deciding on a simple, readable structure to avoid future maintenance headaches.

These are the kinds of trade-offs I made and the problems I took time to solve myself.

## If you want to improve or deploy
- To publish: push the repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings, or use any static host.
- To extend: add build tooling (e.g., a small task runner or bundler) if you plan to include many assets or preprocessors.
